# ShopMate – E-Commerce Web Application (Dissertation Project)

ShopMate is an e-commerce web application developed as part of my **final year dissertation project**.  
The goal of the project was to design and implement a scalable online shopping platform, focusing on core e-commerce functionality, system architecture, and user experience.

This repository contains a **partial but functional version** of the project. The original work was developed using my university account; this repo reflects the main structure and logic for discussion and review purposes.
